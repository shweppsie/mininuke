# Mininuke #

Media Center File Browser

(c) 2010 GNU GPL v3

I tried so many media center software 
packages but none met my needs. So I
wrote my own. Tell me if you like it.

# Aims for Mininuke #
*   Simplicity
*   Modular

# Installation #
Mininuke requres Python and Pyglet to
run. Get pyglet from 

*   http://www.pyglet.org/download.html

then run ./mininuke

# Configuration #
mininuke will read a config file from 
    ~/.mininuke.rc
of the form below. Below the defaults 
are shown.

    path=./
    [mplayer]
    path=/usr/bin/mplayer
